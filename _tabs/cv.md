- During my tenure as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at the University of Maryland, I played a significant role in teaching courses focused on Secure Operating Systems and Applied Cryptography. In this capacity, I facilitated discussions centered on various aspects of OS security, vulnerabilities, and cryptographic principles, thereby enhancing students' understanding and analytical skills.

- Prior to my academic role, I worked as a Security Engineer (holding positions such as Security Champion and DevSecOps Specialist) at Oracle Health (Cerner), where I conducted thorough security audits and spearheaded remediation efforts to address vulnerabilities within the US Veteran Affairs domain.
