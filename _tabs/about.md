# 👋 Hello there! I'm Narayan Ram Naryanan - aka N2R 

- Currently calling Maryland, USA my home base.🏠
- By day, I'm a graduate teaching assistant and a cyber security graduate student at the University of Maryland. When the sun sets, I'm a relentless security researcher.
- With a passion for Linux, cryptography, and all things infosec, I'm on a quest to fortify the digital defenses and decode cyber threats. 💻🔐🛡️
- My cybersecurity journey started before grad school, with 3 years of experience as a security champion and devsecops engineer. 🎓💼
- You'll often find me knee-deep in programming, crafting solutions to intricate security puzzles. But hey, I'm not just about bytes and bits; I'm on top of the latest cyber trends, attending conferences, CTFs, and staying informed. 💡🔍
- Whether it's keeping digital castles secure or decoding cyber puzzles, you can bet I'm on board. Let's tidy up our digital playground, one line of code at a time! 😎👾
